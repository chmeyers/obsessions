# Limit the number of Rocko Supremes that a player can add to a fleet.
# They can't build any, but without this they can try to add an unlimited amount when
# designing a fleet.

# It seems that this can only be done by overwriting the default behavior,
# and so could be non-compatible with other mods and changes to the base game.
# For this reason, I've commented it out, as I would rather have compatibility.
