obsessions_mod.3.name:0 "It's still just a Rock"
obsessions_mod.3.desc:0 "Further observation of the asteroid continue to point to it being a boring rock. The crew has named it $NAME_Obsessions_Mod_Rocko$."

obsessions_mod.4.name:0 "It's still still just a Rock"
obsessions_mod.4.desc:0 "Word has leaked out about asteroid $NAME_Obsessions_Mod_Rocko$. Perhaps the story grew in the retelling, or perhaps there really is something special about that rock, but a group of colonists is clamoring to see it up close."

obsessions_mod.6.a:0 "No. There is no way it's possible."

A true testament to the strength of our civilization. Some of the population want it to be declared consecrated. You're still pretty sure it's just a rock."
obsessions_mod.7.a:0 "Bringing it here was a breakthrough in physics."
obsessions_mod.7.b:0 "The largest object ever brought through a hyperspace breach."
obsessions_mod.7.c:0 "Is it getting closer?"
obsessions_mod.7.c.tooltip:0 "Did anybody think through the implications of placing a large rock in an unstable orbit over our capital? The rock will crash into the capital, killing millions. This probably would have worked out better if the capital was on a planet.\n§Y1§ £pops£ Pop killed."
