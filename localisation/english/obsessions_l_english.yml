obsessions_mod.4.name:0 "It's still still just a Rock"
obsessions_mod.4.desc:0 "Word has leaked out about asteroid $NAME_Obsessions_Mod_Rocko$. Perhaps the story grew in the retelling, or perhaps there really is something special about that rock, but a group of colonists is clamoring to see it up close."

obsessions_mod.6.desc:0 "They're back. Things were quiet for years, but now a movement has started, asking for something to be done to bring the enlightenment of $NAME_Obsessions_Mod_Rocko$ to all.

obsessions_mod.6.a:0 "No. There is no way it's possible."
