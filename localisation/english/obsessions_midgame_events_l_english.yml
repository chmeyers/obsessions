black_hole_obsession_chain_desc:0 "One of our scientists believes that a detailed comparative analysis of several black holes will provide insight into their temporal dilation effects. They insist that this isn't just an excuse for them to go traipsing around the galaxy."

obsessions_midgame.201.name:0 "Idle Hands"
obsessions_midgame.201.desc:0 "One of our idle scientists has been spending an inordinate amount of time analyzing the astronomical data of distant black holes. This seems to have become a bit of an obsession with them. They would like to begin an expedition to observe several black holes and try some sort of temporal experiment. They have put together a list of candidate systems that meet their needs."

obsessions_midgame.401.name:0 "Black Hole analyzed"
obsessions_midgame.401.desc:0 "[leader.GetName] has completed the temporal analysis of a black hole. They believe there is value in doing one final close pass to the event horizon, though this will require overriding some of the ship's safety protocols."

obsessions_midgame.501.name:0 "Time Flies"
obsessions_midgame.501.desc:0 "[from.GetName] has finished their flyby of the event horizon. They are happy with the data they've gathered. The excitement makes them feel twenty years younger. In fact, they ARE twenty years younger, a temporal effect of the black hole that they hope to be able to explain by further data analysis. It's a good thing they weren't too young."
obsessions_midgame.501.a:0 "On to the next one."
obsessions_midgame.501.b:0 "Did you learn anything?"

obsessions_midgame.502.name:0 "Did you learn anything?"
obsessions_midgame.502.desc:0 "[from.GetName] feels that the data from the flybys they conducted was crucial and has allowed them to extend their initiali theories extensively."
obsessions_midgame.502.desc_more:0 "[from.GetName] feels they could have learned more if they had done more flybys of the event horizons, but they do have a solid set of data with which to work."
obsessions_midgame.502.a:0 "Okay"

obsessions_midgame.503.name:0 "Unborn and Unassembled"
obsessions_midgame.503.desc:0 "[from.GetName] seems to have disappeared during the final pass of the black hole's event horizon. Surveilance video of their lab shows them rapidly regressing in age to the point where they entirely vanished. Their collegues theorize that they were no longer old enough to survive."
obsessions_midgame.503.a:0 "Intriguing."

obsessions_midgame.504.name:0 "Reborn and Reassembled"
obsessions_midgame.504.desc:0 "A remarkable young scientist has just completed their training. Unusually, they appear to be [event_target:obsessed_scientist_blackhole.GetName], the same scientist who disappeared several decades ago while investigating the temporal effect of black holes. When questioned about the similarity, they showed no memory of a previous life."
obsessions_midgame.504.a:0 "Recruit them."

obsessions_midgame.504.b:0 "Too Suspicious."
