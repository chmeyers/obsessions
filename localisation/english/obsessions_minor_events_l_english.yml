obsessions_mod_category_asteroid_1:0 "Accelerating Asteroid."
obsessions_mod_category_asteroid_1_desc:0 "The asteroid [Root.GetName] has caught the attention of our Science Officer due to minor changes in it's orbital velocity that suggest it is actively navigating the asteroid field."

# Outgassing asteroid
obsessions_mod_minor.1.name:0 "Rocky outgassing"
obsessions_mod_minor.1.desc:0 "Investigation has shown that the asteroid's acceleration is due to natural outgassing from some unstable craters on the rock's surface."
obsessions_mod_minor.1.a:0 "Drill into one of the craters."
obsessions_mod_minor.1.b:0 "Perhaps our own ships could accelerate in this fashion."
obsessions_mod_minor.1.c:0 "Analyze the gases."

obsessions_mod_minor.2.name:0 "Rocky outgassing"
obsessions_mod_minor.2.desc:0 "Careful drilling allowed us to tap into a contained reservoir of gases."
obsessions_mod_minor.2.desc_bad:0 "The crew bungled the drilling, causing an explosive pressure release from an underground reservoir of gas and narrowly escaping uninjured. Any gases that remained on the asteroid were lost."
obsessions_mod_minor.2.a:0 "Wonderful."
obsessions_mod_minor.2.b:0 "Disappointing."

obsessions_mod_minor.3.name:0 "Rocky outgassing"
obsessions_mod_minor.3.desc:0 "Careful investigation of the outgassing has given us a new insight into propulsion."
obsessions_mod_minor.3.desc_bad:0 "The acceleration given by the gases does not appear to be an improvement on our current technology."
obsessions_mod_minor.3.a:0 "Wonderful."
obsessions_mod_minor.3.b:0 "Disappointing."

# Life-filled asteroid
obsessions_mod_minor.4.name:0 "Unusual Life"
obsessions_mod_minor.4.desc:0 "A close scan of the asteroid immediately revealed that it is covered in single-celled plant life, which is altering the asteroid's orbit by cycling through different albedos."
obsessions_mod_minor.4.a:0 "Test the lifeforms."
obsessions_mod_minor.4.b:0 "Destroy them to be safe."
obsessions_mod_minor.4.c:0 "It appears edible."

obsessions_mod_minor.5.name:0 "Unusual Life"
obsessions_mod_minor.5.desc:0 "Extensive experimentation has shown the plants to be not only safe, but tasty."
obsessions_mod_minor.5.desc_bad:0 "Despite precautions, the lifeforms infected our Science Officer. Though we were able to eradicate them, it was not without side effects."
obsessions_mod_minor.5.a:0 "Amazing."
obsessions_mod_minor.5.b:0 "Unfortunate."

obsessions_mod_minor.6.name:0 "Unusual Life"
obsessions_mod_minor.6.desc:0 "Our Science Officer has learned much from the thorough destruction."
obsessions_mod_minor.6.desc_bad:0 "The crew is disappointed that we wasted this opportunity to examine the lifeforms."
obsessions_mod_minor.6.a:0 "Amazing."
obsessions_mod_minor.6.b:0 "Unfortunate."

# Glitch in our sensors
obsessions_mod_minor.7.name:0 "Nothing to See"
obsessions_mod_minor.7.desc:0 "After tracking the asteroid through a portion of it's orbit our Science Officer has determined that the asteroid is normal and it was the computer analysis of the sensor logs which was in error."
obsessions_mod_minor.7.a:0 "Investigate the error."
obsessions_mod_minor.7.b:0 "Someone is to blame."
obsessions_mod_minor.7.c:0 "Correct the bug."

obsessions_mod_minor.8.name:0 "Nothing to See"
obsessions_mod_minor.8.desc:0 "Our Science Officer has learned alot investigating the problem."
obsessions_mod_minor.8.desc_bad:0 "It seems the source of the problem was the science officer themself. They have been disciplined."
obsessions_mod_minor.8.a:0 "Excellent."
obsessions_mod_minor.8.b:0 "Foolish."

obsessions_mod_minor.9.name:0 "Nothing to See"
obsessions_mod_minor.9.desc:0 "It seems the source of the problem was the science officer themself. The errors in their training have been rectified."
obsessions_mod_minor.9.desc_bad:0 "It seems the source of the problem was the science officer themself. They have not taken the criticism well."
obsessions_mod_minor.9.a:0 "Excellent."
obsessions_mod_minor.9.b:0 "Foolish."
