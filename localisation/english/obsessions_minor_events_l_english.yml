obsessions_mod_category_asteroid_1:0 "Accelerating Asteroid"
obsessions_mod_category_asteroid_1_desc:0 "The asteroid [Root.GetName] has caught the attention of our Science Officer due to minor changes in it's orbital velocity that suggest it is actively navigating the asteroid field."

# Outgassing asteroid
obsessions_mod_minor.1.name:0 "Rocky outgassing"
obsessions_mod_minor.1.desc:0 "Investigation has shown that the asteroid's acceleration is due to natural outgassing from some unstable craters on the rock's surface."
obsessions_mod_minor.1.a:0 "Drill into one of the craters."
obsessions_mod_minor.1.b:0 "Perhaps our own ships could accelerate in this fashion."
obsessions_mod_minor.1.c:0 "Analyze the gases."

obsessions_mod_minor.2.name:0 "Rocky outgassing"
obsessions_mod_minor.2.desc:0 "Careful drilling allowed us to tap into a contained reservoir of gases."
obsessions_mod_minor.2.desc_bad:0 "The crew bungled the drilling, causing an explosive pressure release from an underground reservoir of gas and narrowly escaping uninjured. Any gases that remained on the asteroid were lost."
obsessions_mod_minor.2.a:0 "Wonderful."
obsessions_mod_minor.2.b:0 "Disappointing."

obsessions_mod_minor.3.name:0 "Rocky outgassing"
obsessions_mod_minor.3.desc:0 "Careful investigation of the outgassing has given us a new insight into propulsion."
obsessions_mod_minor.3.desc_bad:0 "The acceleration given by the gases does not appear to be an improvement on our current technology."
obsessions_mod_minor.3.a:0 "Wonderful."
obsessions_mod_minor.3.b:0 "Disappointing."

# Life-filled asteroid
obsessions_mod_minor.4.name:0 "Unusual Life"
obsessions_mod_minor.4.desc:0 "A close scan of the asteroid immediately revealed that it is covered in single-celled plant life, which is altering the asteroid's orbit by cycling through different albedos."
obsessions_mod_minor.4.a:0 "Test the lifeforms."
obsessions_mod_minor.4.b:0 "Destroy them to be safe."
obsessions_mod_minor.4.c:0 "It appears edible."

obsessions_mod_minor.5.name:0 "Unusual Life"
obsessions_mod_minor.5.desc:0 "Extensive experimentation has shown the plants to be not only safe, but tasty."
obsessions_mod_minor.5.desc_bad:0 "Despite precautions, the lifeforms infected our Science Officer. Though we were able to eradicate them, it was not without side effects."
obsessions_mod_minor.5.a:0 "Amazing."
obsessions_mod_minor.5.b:0 "Unfortunate."

obsessions_mod_minor.6.name:0 "Unusual Life"
obsessions_mod_minor.6.desc:0 "Our Science Officer has learned much from the thorough destruction."
obsessions_mod_minor.6.desc_bad:0 "The crew is disappointed that we wasted this opportunity to examine the lifeforms."
obsessions_mod_minor.6.a:0 "Amazing."
obsessions_mod_minor.6.b:0 "Unfortunate."

# Glitch in our sensors
obsessions_mod_minor.7.name:0 "Nothing to See"
obsessions_mod_minor.7.desc:0 "After tracking the asteroid through a portion of it's orbit our Science Officer has determined that the asteroid is normal and it was the computer analysis of the sensor logs which was in error."
obsessions_mod_minor.7.a:0 "Investigate the error."
obsessions_mod_minor.7.b:0 "Someone is to blame."
obsessions_mod_minor.7.c:0 "Correct the bug."

obsessions_mod_minor.8.name:0 "Nothing to See"
obsessions_mod_minor.8.desc:0 "Our Science Officer has learned alot investigating the problem."
obsessions_mod_minor.8.desc_bad:0 "It seems the source of the problem was the science officer themself. They have been disciplined."
obsessions_mod_minor.8.a:0 "Excellent."
obsessions_mod_minor.8.b:0 "Foolish."

obsessions_mod_minor.9.name:0 "Nothing to See"
obsessions_mod_minor.9.desc:0 "It seems the source of the problem was the science officer themself. The errors in their training have been rectified."
obsessions_mod_minor.9.desc_bad:0 "It seems the source of the problem was the science officer themself. They have not taken the criticism well."
obsessions_mod_minor.9.a:0 "Excellent."
obsessions_mod_minor.9.b:0 "Foolish."

obsessions_mod_category_ice_asteroid_1:0 "Temperature Anomaly"
obsessions_mod_category_ice_asteroid_1_desc:0 "Our infrared sensors indicate that the ice asteroid [Root.GetName] has a temperature inconsistent with it's orbital distance from the star."

# Asteroid too hot
obsessions_mod_minor.10.name:0 "Asteroid Too Hot"
obsessions_mod_minor.10.desc:0 "Observations of the ice asteroid show that it is hotter than it should be. The interior of the asteroid is composed of liquid water with a thin ice crust and likely contains life. Closer investigations have revealed that the excess heat is generated by numerous radioactive isotopes present in the water. We could collect the isotopes or attempt to study the asteroid's interior."
obsessions_mod_minor.10.a:0 "Collect the energy."
obsessions_mod_minor.10.b:0 "Study the organisms."
obsessions_mod_minor.10.c:0 "Both might be possible."

obsessions_mod_minor.11.name:0 "Asteroid Too Hot"
obsessions_mod_minor.11.desc:0 "Our Science Officer has managed to collect the majority of the isotopes without disturbing the asteroid's ecosystem."
obsessions_mod_minor.11.desc_bad:0 "The isotope collection went as planned, and the asteroid froze solid shortly afterwards, destroying any life inside."
obsessions_mod_minor.11.a:0 "Great."
obsessions_mod_minor.11.b:0 "A pity."

obsessions_mod_minor.12.name:0 "Asteroid Too Hot"
obsessions_mod_minor.12.desc:0 "After studying the ecosystem, our Science Officer has determined that we can tap into a limited amount of energy without disturbing the ecosystem."
obsessions_mod_minor.12.desc_bad:0 "The lifeforms inside are of some interest."
obsessions_mod_minor.12.a:0 "Great."
obsessions_mod_minor.12.b:0 "Interesting."

# Asteroid too cold
obsessions_mod_minor.13.name:0 "Asteroid Too Cold"
obsessions_mod_minor.13.desc:0 "Observations of the ice asteroid show that it is colder than it should be. At this distance from the nearest star, it should be liquid, but has maintained a frozen state. Further investigation has shown this to be due to numerous crystals infused in the ice. Our Science Officer wishes to study the crystals."
obsessions_mod_minor.13.a:0 "Leave the crystals for Mining."
obsessions_mod_minor.13.b:0 "Allow the crystals to be studied."

obsessions_mod_minor.14.name:0 "Asteroid Too Cold"
obsessions_mod_minor.14.desc:0 "Our Science Officer has learned a significant amount from the crystals."
obsessions_mod_minor.14.desc_bad:0 "Oh no. The fumbling of our inexperienced Science Officer has destroyed most of the crystals. We have salvaged what they can."
obsessions_mod_minor.14.a:0 "Great."
obsessions_mod_minor.14.b:0 "Oh no."

# Asteroid just right, but metallic signature.
obsessions_mod_minor.15.name:0 "Asteroid Just Right"
obsessions_mod_minor.15.desc:0 "Observations of the ice asteroid show that it is actually the correct temperature for it's orbit, but a large metallic deposit on it's surface caused the sensors to read the temperature incorrectly. The deposit appears to be made up of high quality alloys. Our Science Officer would like to extract the deposit for study."
obsessions_mod_minor.15.a:0 "Leave the alloys for proper mining."
obsessions_mod_minor.15.b:0 "Extract and study the alloys."
